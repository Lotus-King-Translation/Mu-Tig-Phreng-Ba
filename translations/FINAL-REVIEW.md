# Post-translation review — Phase D

**State: in progress; not text-ready or a release approval.** Date: 2026-10-05. Reviewer/session: **GPT-6 Astra Pro / MTP-PhaseD-20261005**. This session is independent of the prior authoring runs listed below. Verification of repairs made by this session is a **self-check**, not a second independent review. Git commits use the repository owner’s configured identity; that is not a claim of human language certification.

## Authority and frozen inputs

The owner’s current `POST_TRANSLATION_REVIEW`, `review-and-revise` instruction authorizes the complete existing English and translation-note review in this repository only, minimal supported corrections, dependent-reader regeneration and ordinary commits/pushes. It does not authorize Tibetan changes, segmentation changes, glossary reassignment, a new formal release or tag movement. See the appended local decision.

The input is `46110acd02a6caa14a00f91605c1a478eda72bcd` (remote `main`, merge of policy-adoption PR [#1](https://github.com/Lotus-King-Translation/Mu-Tig-Phreng-Ba/pull/1), merged 2026-10-05T06:35:03Z). Existing English edition: `translation-v1`; its fixed release peels to `f9839a3caa0d1920f596c12bc796adae4c58b39b`. Golden edition: `golden-v1`, commit `4d6ba07e1b3379183633127cd387d98d8195eb95`; governing payload is **golden/reading.json**, not reading.md.

Active common policy: template commit `882454cb2576d0b2529296bd7a3a7c87371ab4cf`, standard **2.1.0, Parts I–III**, complete **283 data rows / eight columns** and adopted P1/P2/P3. Current glossary and standard bytes were compared with that exact upstream commit via GitHub and match. Part I §8.1 and Part III were read. All startup files were read. No later owner-approved local terminology exception was found; prior drafting/publication exceptions retain only their recorded historical scope. Initial template provenance and old proposals are not substituted for this adoption.

Initial checkout was clean on `policy/adopt-template-882454cb` at `c622e6a`; no unpublished commits or unstaged/untracked work were present. Its content equals the merged remote main. Local main was fast-forwarded without rewriting history, then `review/phase-d-20261005` was created at the frozen input. The existing archive/review branches and sole worktree were preserved. Remote main is unprotected and has no rulesets; the recent workflow uses a pull request. No GitHub Releases were returned by `gh release list`; the existing annotated tags/receipts are the relevant formal editions.

## Finite whole-work inventory and coverage

Every pair, including metadata, opening headings, all source annotations and closing material, is in scope. Pair counts are representation/coverage counts, never accuracy percentages. The eight current chapter inventories were parsed from authored files, not an old audit.

| Chapter | Expected pair range | Pairs | Golden objects | Notes | Input unresolved | Prior author / reviewer | Actually reviewed |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | `MTP-000001`–`MTP-000030` | 30 | 97 | 112 | 1 | `translation author /root/golden_triage` / `coordinating agent /root` | Pairs 000001–000030 read; note reconciliation in progress |
| 2 | `MTP-000031`–`MTP-000065` | 35 | 124 | 175 | 4 | `/root/ch02_translate` / `/root/ch02_qc` | Not yet reviewed |
| 3 | `MTP-000066`–`MTP-000099` | 34 | 120 | 165 | 2 | `/root/ch02_translate` / `/root/ch02_qc` | Not yet reviewed |
| 4 | `MTP-000100`–`MTP-000185` | 86 | 294 | 396 | 5 | `/root/ch04_author` / `/root/ch04_qc` | Not yet reviewed |
| 5 | `MTP-000186`–`MTP-000320` | 135 | 416 | 520 | 16 | `/root/ch05_translate` / `/root/ch05_qc` | Not yet reviewed |
| 6 | `MTP-000321`–`MTP-000452` | 132 | 376 | 435 | 21 | `/root/ch06_translate` / `/root/ch06_qc` | Not yet reviewed |
| 7 | `MTP-000453`–`MTP-000567` | 115 | 342 | 373 | 45 | `/root/ch07_translate` / `/root/ch07_qc` | Not yet reviewed |
| 8 | `MTP-000568`–`MTP-000674` | 107 | 284 | 421 | 46 | `/root/ch08_translate` / `/root/ch08_qc` | Not yet reviewed |

Total: **674 pairs; 2,053 source objects; 2,597 locally linked notes; 140 input unresolved pairs; 127 nontranslatable metadata pairs.** Pair-status files remain the occurrence-level unresolved inventory. Source roles: 530 main-text, 127 metadata, three headings, nine chapter-colophon, three source-annotation and two work-colophon pairs. The chapter-5 interrupted colophon and chapter-8 narrative, colophons, notices and triple blessing are included.

Existing records used: this report’s preserved historical section, `AGGREGATE-QC.md`, `AGGREGATE-CHECKS.json`, the eight chapter `QC.md`, `FINAL-REVIEW.md`, `qc.json`, `signoff.json`, `usage.json`, `glossary-proposals.json`, source audits and current note maps. Historical aggregate manual sampling is not counted as this review. The 30 golden transcript corrections and separate native-audit findings must be checked as current source history, not automatically reissued as English defects. No fixed-golden payload update was found; later paired-source commits assemble the chapter prefix. The historical author drafts remain archival inputs, not editorial targets.

Authored English is `translations/chapters/NN/translation.md`, assembled into `paired/translation.md` under the local pipeline schema. Chapter/whole-book readers and machine projections are generated. The original final gates intentionally bind fixed release bytes and old policy pins. Their rejection of current policy adoption is retained, not bypassed as release approval. A working-text rebuild must preserve that distinction.

## Initial findings recorded before correction

These findings are **recorded, not yet applied**. They will be extended only to occurrences confirmed by reading the current source.

| Finding | Location and exact Tibetan | Before English | Smallest supported after | Rationale / severity / confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PD-001 | MTP-000006: `བཅོམ་ལྡན་འདས` | `Bhagavān` | `Blessed One` | Full P2 honorific row; retain the rest of the awareness/identity construction. Terminology, medium; high. |
| PD-002 | MTP-000015: `དཀྱིལ་འཁོར` | `maṇḍala` | `mandala` | P2 spelling policy only; does not settle thugs/citta or its locative relation. Terminology, low; high. |
| PD-003 | MTP-000026: `འདུལ་བ་དང / མདོ་སྡེ་དང / མངོན་པ་ལ་སོགས་པ་དང` (slashes show existing object boundaries) | `Vinaya, Sūtra, Abhidharma, and so forth;` | `discipline, discourse collection, higher doctrine, and so forth;` | P2 category rows govern this explicit collection list; keep source order and continuation. Terminology, medium; high. |

Chapter-1 no-change controls already checked: MTP-000007 says “taught,” not the later “heard” at 000015; 000008 retains negation and its documented unresolved temporal relation; 000012 technical Ground already has approved capitalization; 000024 is a sensory sound use, not a linguistic word use; 000029 `ཐབས་ཅིག` means the assembly’s “together,” not a new technical means occurrence; 000030 `གླེང་གཞི` is the whole setting expression, not standalone Ground. Title/colophon tantra, sensory sound, Ground, identity, realm, citta-retention and object notes need policy-status reconciliation without erasing their independent syntax uncertainties. The Tathāgata title, full vajra-chain overlap, and thugs/citta construction retain exact linked provisional treatment pending construction evidence.

## Actual validation observations

Baseline commands run by this session, before English or note edits:

| Command | Actual result |
| --- | --- |
| `python3 -B scripts/validate_paired.py` | FAIL: `PAIRED VALIDATION FAILED: invalid pair metadata for M` (0.048 s). Pre-existing generic-parser failure. |
| `python3 -B scripts/validate_translation_aggregate.py` | FAIL: `Prior released input changed: glossary/expanded_tibetan_english_glossary.csv` (1.705 s). Pre-existing policy/release-pin incompatibility. |
| `python3 -B scripts/build_golden_aggregate.py verify` | FAIL: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named pyewts` (0.191 s); system Python environment, not evidence of changed Tibetan. |

No semantic regression fixture is claimed run from reading the standard. Further tests, changed-clause self-checks, generated-output reproduction and remote verification are pending.

## Continuation and disposition

Continue chapter 1 active-note reconciliation, then source-order pair 000031 through 000674. Whole-work terminology concordance, continuous English check, supported repairs, note/usage dispositions, reader regeneration and final verification remain. **Review coverage is partial; text readiness is not yet assessed.** This is not human certification or a harmonization claim for the other three works.

---

The following historical release review is preserved verbatim; its approval applies only to its recorded fixed inputs, not to subsequent Phase D edits.

# Coordinator final review — translation-v1

Date: 2026-10-04. Reviewer and release coordinator: `/root`.

Approved for the bounded annotated working-edition release at build-manifest SHA-256 `7a4693c3eaffa12d94af78a147a7289d9701c4061ad41fbb0532ebbc9a604a07`. All eight chapter translations and their actual fixed releases are present. This approval covers faithful assembly and publication of the separately reviewed chapters, with inherited uncertainties retained.

## Exact scope and evidence

The edition represents all 2,053 fixed golden objects in 674 pairs, with 2,597 endnotes and all 2,199 required source obligations. Nothing remains to draft within the eight-chapter scope. Pair dispositions remain 407 translated, 140 unresolved and 127 nontranslatable; representation does not imply that uncertain wording has been resolved.

I read the complete independent assembly review and its machine check record. Reviewer `/root/ch04_structure` verified the complete source/pair/note/obligation identity, all eight fixed chapter inventories and release identities, the 369 bound inputs, and all English and bilingual display projections. Its declared reader sample comprises 63 pair treatments, including 31 bilingual treatments and 15 note definitions. This independent assembly review is distinct from the chapter translators' own checks and from my coordinating signoff.

I inspected the aggregate opening, the corrected bilingual title MTP-000005, the final narrative MTP-000668–670, the work colophon, both post-work annotations and the triple blessing MTP-000671–674. I also read the actual aggregate definitions T02-005, CH02-G000117, T04-008, T04-010, T08-066 and T08-068. The exact source qualifications, provisional syntax, received colophon number and unresolved mother/child grouping remain explicit. Chapter 4's fresh reviewed corrections are included through its fixed release; its original author archive remains preserved.

Two aggregate-only presentation findings were corrected before approval: visible bilingual verse/headings/source roles, and the two-line Tibetan h2 title displayed as one heading. For the final correction I checked the code diff, the actual heading and manifest delta. Only the builder input and that one bilingual display changed; the other 368 inputs and complete English, machine and coverage outputs remain exact. Canonical and signed chapter strings were not rewritten.

## Validation and publication boundary

The actual aggregate passes read-only reproduction. The same final validator used for approval first rejected the real unsigned candidate with “Unsigned translation aggregate: final signoff missing”; that record binds this manifest. The new approval/hash-binding gate has 17 recorded passing synthetic tests and an independent code review. The affected aggregate suite passes all 24 tests on its single retry. Its initial setup-only failure, unreproduced diagnostic and successful retry are recorded transparently; no source pin or gate was relaxed. These structural tests do not certify translation semantics.

Fresh remote observations independently match all eight annotated chapter tag objects and peeled commits, the fixed golden tag and the observed main commit. The publication gate will repeat this remote check against the clean committed signoff state before creating `translation-v1`. A verified receipt will follow the fixed tag; the tag will not move. This review does not claim that those subsequent publication actions have already occurred.

## Remaining qualifications

The active glossary, translation standard and governing golden text remain fixed. Proposed terminology remains inactive. This is an agent-produced working edition for human review, with 140 unresolved pairs and 101 preserved source uncertainty statements. The aggregate review adds no fresh whole-book semantic certification, native-image proofreading, commentary decipherment, exhaustive witness collation or independent human certification. The separate chapter reviews and explicit local notes define the scope of the language and source work already performed.

No assembly correction blocker remains. The signoff binds this review, the exact manifest and outputs, the independent review records, the actual unsigned rejection, remote observations, test records and the executing final validator.
